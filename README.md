<h1>Browser Refresh</h1>

<b>Linux only</b><br>
Finds and refreshes the active browser based on a filter in its URL.
Can be attached to keyboard shortcut.

Excellent tool for web developers, they don't have to leave the editor and grab the mouse to refresh the browser. It saves me about 20% of the development time.

Dependencies (all Linux packages):
<ul>
  <li>xdotool</li>
  <li>xterm</li>
  <li>xsel</li>
</ul>
